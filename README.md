# Baoxing's CV

Now I am a Ph.D. at MPIPZ. I am developing pipelines for GWAS and natural variation analysis.

I have a biological bachelor degree, then I switched to bioinformatics for Master and Ph.D. degree. I spent a lot of efforts to teach myself for programming skills and mathematical knowledge by reading books with a total height of several meters. For programming, instead of focusing on program language, I think algorithm and data structure etc. is more important for a professional bioinformatician. But with the desire for understating the details of some daily software, which is not well documented, I learned almost all the popular bioinformatics program language.

My medium-term interest has been in design and implementing methods to maximize the use of high-through put data, to explore the evolution, artificial/natural selection, demographic history of organisms. And uncover the relationship and intermediate pathways between phenotype and genotype. My long-term aim is to provide human beings better food and keep human beings from diseases.
